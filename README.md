# SEALServer
Basic FHE service using Microsoft SEAL Library

This server implements a bare bones implementation of a webservice providing fully homomorphic encryption services using the Microsoft SEAL library (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-seal/). The webservice currently supports Add operations. It does demonstrate how to serialize/deserialize SEAL objects over the wire to implement basic client/server functionality.
